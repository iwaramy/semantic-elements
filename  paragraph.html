2. Write one paragraph summarizing what semantic elements are (max of 150 words)

Semantic element describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.
Examples of non-semantic elements: <div> and <span> - Tells nothing about its content.
Examples of semantic elements: <form>, <table>, and <article> - Defines its content.
Semantic HTML is HTML that introduces meaning to the web page rather than just
presentation. For example, a <p> tag indicates that the enclosed text is a paragraph.
Semantic tags are used to enhance the accessibility, search ability, interoperability
and for international standard.
Examples of semantic HTML tags include the header tags <h1> through <h6>, <blockquote>,
 <code> and <em>. There are many more semantic HTML tags that can be while building
a standards-compliant website.
HTML5 includes additional semantic elements new to HTML such as:
•	article
•	detail
•	figure
•	footer
•	header
•	main
•	mark
•	section
•	summary
