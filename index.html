    <h6>Front-end web development</h6>
  <p>
  Front-end web development is the practice of converting data to graphical interface for user to view and<br>
  interact with data through digital interaction using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.<br>
  Tools used for front-end development<br>
  There are several tools and platform (wordpress, magento etc..) available that can be used to<br>
  develop the front end of a website, and understanding which tools are best fit for specific tasks<br>
  marks the difference between developing a hacked site and a well designed, scalable site<br>

  <b> Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML)</b> <br>
  Hyper Text Markup Language(HTML) is the backbone of any <sup> website development</sup> process, without which <br>
  a web page doesn't exist. <mark> Hypertext </mark> means that text has links, termed<br>
  hyperlinks <a href="https://www.behance.net/yugeshiwaram/">, </a> embedded in it.<br>
  When a user clicks on a word or a phrase that has a hyperlink, it will bring another web-page.<br>
  A markup language indicates text can be turned into images, tables, links, and other representations.<br>
  It is the <i> HTML </i> code that provides an overall framework of how the site will look. HTML was developed<br>
  byÂ Tim Berners-Lee. The latest version of <strong> HTML </strong> is called <small> HTML5 </small> and was <sub> published </sub> on October<br>
   28, 2014 by the W3 recommendation. This version contains new and efficient ways of handling elements such as video and audio files.<br>
